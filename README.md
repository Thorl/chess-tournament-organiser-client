# Chess Tournament Organiser 

## We present a MERN stack application that allows users to easily run chess tournaments and store participant data.

This project presents an MVP for a Chess Tournament Organiser application which follows the Swiss Tournament format. Users can sign up for an account and use this application to help them run chess tournaments with ease, as well save records of classes and tournaments in the database. 
The motivation for this project arose out of a need to optimise the process of running chess tournaments in schools. Doing so manually is very time-consuming and does not lend itself well to the chaos of a classroom. This application provides a streamlined approach to running such an activity.

Below is a list of features that the application currently offer:

* Sign up for an account and edit account details;
* Create classes with students in them;
* Create a tournament by loading an existing class into that tournament. Select the students from the class that you would like to participate in the tournament using a checkbox interface
* The tournament details page features two views: Matches View and Points View;
* Matches View displays the pairings for each round, under which are buttons to select the result of each match;

* Points View displays a table which records the results of each round and keeps a running tally of the each participant's total points;

### Below is a list of features we hope to implement 

* A Student Details page, where all tournament data for a given student can be accessed and visualised. This would help teachers to keep track fo their students' progress.
* A re-generate round pairings feature; this would offer the teacher an easy work-around for instances where the algorithm's initial pairings are for some reason problematic in the context of the classroom.
* A blacklisted students feature. This would allow the teacher to prevent the algorithms from producing specific pairings in the event that, for example, two students in the class do not work well together.
